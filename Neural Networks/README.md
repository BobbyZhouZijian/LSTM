# LSTM Model Implementation

- This directory contains model that uses LSTM to predict future prices of forex market
- Data based on GBP/USD, scraped from Bloomberg Terminal

## Development tools

- python

- tensorflow

- keras

- scikit-learn


## Why LSTM rather than RNN?
We have carefully analysed the rationale behind using LSTM for the prediction of forex price. The main reason includes:
- 1. LSTM has memory. So it can memorize the data in the past, making its prediction more reliable.
- 2. LSTM prevents weights from diminishing to zero quickly or exploding.
