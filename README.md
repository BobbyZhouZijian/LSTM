## Using LSTM for Forex Trading
- Using keras for machine learning and scikit-learn for data crunching
- The main code is in /Neural Networks/LSTM.jpynb. You would need Jupyter Notebook to edit the code after cloning it to your local machine.
- The `sharpe ratio` calculated is `1.29` (which is fairly good). The `maximum drawdown` is at 2400, which is quite small as compared to the 
total profit under our trading strategy designed based on the prediction model.

## Using classifiers to analysis Forex
- We created a meta-classifier by combining Random Forest, Xg-boost and SVM through logistic regression. 

- The next step would be to train models on the the features and carry out feature selection.
