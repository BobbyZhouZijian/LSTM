## Why LSTM rather than RNN?
We have cerafully analysed the rationale behind using LSTM for the prediction of forex price. The main reason includes:
- 1. LSTM has memory. So it can memorize the data in the past, making its prediction more reliable.
- 2. LSTM prevents weights from diminishing to zero quickly or exploding.
